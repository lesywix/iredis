A Terminal Client for Redis with AutoCompletion and Syntax Highlighting. It is an alternative for redis-cli. IRedis is supposed to friendly for both user and redis-server, which means it is safe to use IRedis on production server. IRedis provide a `--strict` mode to prevent accidently running dangerous command, like `KEYS *`\(See [here](https://redis.io/topics/latency), the _Latency generated by slow commands_ section.

**This project is under development, any comments are welcome.**

## Features

* Advanced code completion. If you run command `KEYS` then run `DEL`, iredis will auto complete your command based on `KEYS` result.
* Command validation: `CLUSTER MEET IP PORT`
* Command highlighting, fully based on redis grammar. Any valide command in iredis shell is a valide redis command.
* Ctrl + C to clear cureent line, won't exit redis-cli. Use Ctrl + D  
* Say "Goodbye!" to you when you exit!
* Ctrl + R to open **reverse-i-search** to search through command history.
* Auto suggestions. \(Like [fish shell](http://fishshell.com/).\)
* Support `--encode=utf-8`, to decode Redis' bytes responses.
* Command hint on bottom, include command syntax, supported redis version, and time complexity.
* Offcial docs build in `HELP` command, try `HELP SET`!

## Install

```text
pip install iredis
```

## Usage

```text
$ iredis -h
```

## Development

### Setup Environment

iredis favors [poetry](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry) as a packagement tool. You can setup a develop envioment on your computer easily.

First, install poetry\(You can do it in a python's virtualenv\):

```text
pip install poetry
```

Then run\(which euqals `pip install -e .`\):

```text
poetry install --develop=DEVELOP
```

### Development Logs

Since this is a commandline tool, so we didn't write logs to stdout.

You can `tail -f iredis.log` to see logs, the log is pretty clear, you can see what actually happend from log files.

### Command Reference

There is a full Redis command list in [commands.csv](https://github.com/lesywix/iredis/tree/81892e9083b3ebccef246926076888e986340f96/commands.csv) file, downloaded by:

```text
python scripts/download_redis_commands.py > data/commands.csv
```

`commands.csv` is here only for test if redis.io was updated, do not package it into release.

Current implemented commands: [command\_syntax.csv](https://github.com/lesywix/iredis/tree/81892e9083b3ebccef246926076888e986340f96/command_syntax.csv).

## Planned Features

Please see issue. And you are welcome to submit one.
